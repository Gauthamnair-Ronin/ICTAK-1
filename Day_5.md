# CLT, Hypothesis Testin-1

- Probability of a value occurring after a threshold in a bell curve = integral of the area under that part of curve.
- Probability distribution of a total area is ONE.
- Gaussian distribution 
  - Mean value will be any value 
- Normal distribution is special case of gaussian distribution.
- Sampling of data - Representative sample of small data taken from a large corpus of data as it is more feasible for doing inference. The sample data is supposed to perform and give more or less same results as the large corpus of data.
  - The Entire Data is called  Population
  - A small portion of data taken from population is called Sample
## Central Limit Theorem
When the means of a number of samples taken from a population when population is plotted , it tends to be a normal distribution called Sampling Distribution  and the mean of the SD will approax the mean value of the actual distribution. The higher the number of samples we take, the closer the mean of the SD will be to the mean of the actual distribution.

- Without using CLT, it is possible to measure the significance of a variable in certain cases.
  -  Significance Level or Alpha value Decided by us
    - usually 2 thresholds - 0.05 or 0.01
    - If the probability of a variable is lower than the alpha value, then that event or variable is a rare event.
    - This is called Z-Test

  - Requirement for Z test = Population mean and population standard deviation
    - **z= (x_cap- pop_mean) / (ùûº / sqrt(N))** , where N is the size of sample, x_cap is sample mean, ùûº is pop_SD
## Hypothesis Testing
- Null hypotheses
  - A hypothesis where the effect of  an experiment is assumed to be null or no existent.
- Alternate Hypotheses
  - Opp of null hypo - the hypothesis that says that the experiment do have significant effect on sample/popualtion.
- Paired Test or T test
  - T test 
    - Degree of freedom df = sample size -1
    - **T = (x_cap - u)/(s /sqrt(n))** where s is sample SD, x_cap is sample mean, u( u alla meu anu) = pop_mean and n is sample size
        <br > S/sqrt(N) is called  Standard Error.
    - t =  x - sn  is  the Sample t-test formula
