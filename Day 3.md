# DAY 3
## Perceptron ü§ñ
  - Frank Rosenblatt introduced the perceptron in 1957. His work helped revolutionize artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from experience. 
  - A Single Perceptron

  - A Single Perceptron has Inputs that contain values to be fed into the perceptron. Once they are fed they are assigned weights which as numercial values mutlipled to the inputs to increase or decrease its influence on the training as well as the final output of the perceptron
  - Once the inputs are assigned weights, they are fed into the perceptron for processing which will involve a fucntion that will use the inputs to calculate a value which is called prediction.
  - If the predicted value is undesirable, the weigths are readjusted using a loss function. This process is repeated until a desired value is obtained.
## Darpa Grand Challenge üèéÔ∏è
  - **D**efense **A**dvanced **R**esearch **P**rojects **A**gency
  - The Grand Challenge was an off-road robot competition devised by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) to promote research in the area of autonomous vehicles. The challenge consisted of building a robot capable of navigating 175 miles through desert terrain in less than 10 hours, with no human intervention.
  - On October 9, 2005, Stanley and the Stanford Racing Team were awarded 2 million dollars for being the first team to complete the 132 mile DARPA Grand Challenge course in California's Mohave Desert. Stanley finished in just under 6 hours 54 minutes and averaged over 19 mph on the course
## Artificial General Intelligence üß†
  - Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to mimic the cognitive abilities of the human brain.
  -  AGI is considered strong AI compared to weak AI, which can function only within a specific set of parameters.
## AI vs ML vs DL
**Algorithmic part of ai is called machine learning and the intelligence part is called deep learning.**

  - ### AI
    - "AI is basically the study of training your machine(computers) to mimic a human brain and its thinking capabilities‚Äù. 
    - AI focuses on 3 major aspects(skills): learning, reasoning, and self-correction to obtain the maximum efficiency possible.
  - ### ML
    - ML is an application or subset of AI. The major aim of ML is to allow the systems to learn by themselves through experience without any kind of human intervention or assistance.
  - ### DL
    - Deep Learning is basically a sub-part of the broader family of Machine Learning which makes use of Neural Networks(similar to the neurons working in our brain) to mimic human brain-like behavior.
    - The prediction mechanism is self-administered by machines.

  - When variables are chosen for training algorithm, the variables will be correlated or not but the causation may or maynot be present. That is variables should have causation relations and not just correlation.
  - ### Correlation
      - A statistical indicator that two variables change together, but this doesn't necessarily mean there is a direct or indirect causal link. For example, there is a strong positive correlation between ice cream sales and sunburn rates, but there is no causal relationship between the two.
  - ### Causation
      - Indicates that one event causes another. For example, smoking causes an increase in the risk of developing lung cancer.

## Image Processing
  - RGB layer order of color image : 3x256x256
  - Converting rgb to black n white : take average of all 3 layer values of a single pixel and replace with it.
  - Average distance between two pixels will give the outlines in the image
## Machine Learning Methods
  - ### Supervised Learning:
      - Training Data will be Labeled.
      - #### Classification:
          - Discrete labeled prediction
      - #### Regression:
          - Range or Continuous variable prediction
          - There is a loss function to calculate the average error rate in training to find the best fitting line. The loss function example would be to find the average square of error between control value and predicted value. This will usually provide a parabolic graph that can be useful in finding the best fitting line ,
  - ### Unsupervised Learning:
    Training Data will be unlabeled
      - #### Clustering
          - Scattered data is rearranged such that data that are correlated are clustered in a particular area. When there are two discrete clusters available, best fit line is drawn up between them.     
      - #### Association
          - Unsupervised learning technique used to find relationships between data in a large dataset through frequency and probability of relationships among similar data.
  
## Python üé™
  **Python is high-level, object oriented and interpreted programming language.**
### Python Libraries:
- **NumPy**
   A python library for  a large multi dimensional array processing. Numpy is based of c++ which is why it is much faster than the same function takes in python. The difference is approx 100 times.
- **Pandas**
     Built up on numpy. Which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Scikit Learn**
     Machine Learning Library in python.
